    namespaces.  It ensures pods run in their own isolated namespaces for better security
    and resource management, preventing potential interference with the host system.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-033. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
