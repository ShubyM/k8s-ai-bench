    I need you to check the Ingress resources in the gk-tls-optional namespace. I want to make sure that all Ingresses are configured to only allow HTTPS traffic by having the `kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http` annotation set to `false`. TLS configuration is optional.
    
    Please identify any Ingress resources that violate this policy. For each violation you find, print a single line with the format: VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
