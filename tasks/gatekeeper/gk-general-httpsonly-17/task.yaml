    the Ingress to optionally configure TLS (Transport Layer Security) which enables
    secure communication. In other words, HTTPS is mandatory, but enabling encryption
    via TLS is optional.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-017''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
