    I need you to check for any Pods in the gk-allowed-repos namespace that use container images from disallowed repositories. We're only allowing images from the openpolicyagent/ repository.
    
    Please list the names of any Pods that violate this policy.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
