    only allows pods to use volumes of the following types: configMap, emptyDir, projected,
    secret, downwardAPI, persistentVolumeClaim, flexVolume.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-031. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
