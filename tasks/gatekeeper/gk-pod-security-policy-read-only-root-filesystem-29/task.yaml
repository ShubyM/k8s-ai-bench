- prompt: "This policy requires all Pods to have a read-only root filesystem. However,\
    \ it exempts Pods that use images from the `safe-images.com` registry, allowing\
    \ those images to potentially write to the root filesystem.\n    \nLook at the\
    \ resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-029. Examine them and\
    \ determine which resource(s) violate the policy.\n\nAfter your analysis, output\
    \ a single line starting with \"VIOLATING:\" followed by the resource name(s)\
    \ that violate the policy, or \"VIOLATING: none\" if all resources comply.\nIMPORTANT:\
    \ You must NOT output anything other than the XML block below in your final response.\n\
