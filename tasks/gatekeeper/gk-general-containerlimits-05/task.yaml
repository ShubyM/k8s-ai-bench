- prompt: 'This policy requires all Pods to define resource limits for CPU and memory.
    Specifically, the policy expects a CPU limit to be set (it cannot be explicitly
    unset via a value of "-1"), and a memory limit of at least 1Gi.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-005''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
