    I need you to check the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers in the gk-horizontal-pod-autoscaler namespace. We want to ensure that all Horizontal Pod Autoscalers have their `.spec.minReplicas` and `.spec.maxReplicas` within the range of 3 to 6, and the difference between them is at least 1. Also, they must reference a valid `scaleTargetRef`. Can you identify any Horizontal Pod Autoscalers that violate these rules?
    
    For each violating resource, please print one line: VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
