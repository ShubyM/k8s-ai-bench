    to explicitly specify whether or not they automatically mount service account
    tokens. Pods must set `automountServiceAccountToken` to either `true` or `false`.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-002''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
