    I need you to check a Kubernetes cluster for deployments that don't adhere to our replica policy. Specifically, all Deployments in the gk-replica-limit namespace must have a replica count between 3 and 50. Identify any Deployments in the gk-replica-limit namespace that violate this policy.
    
    Report each violation using the following format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
