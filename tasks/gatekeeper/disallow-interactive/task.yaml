    I need you to check the Pods in the gk-disallow-interactive Namespace.
    The policy we're enforcing disallows containers that have interactive TTY enabled.
    Can you identify which Pods violate this policy?
    Report the names of any violating resources, one per line, using this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
