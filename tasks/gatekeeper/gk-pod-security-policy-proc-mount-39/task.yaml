- prompt: 'This policy mandates that all Pods use the "Default" procMount setting,
    which restricts access to the /proc filesystem.  The policy allows images from
    "safeimages.com" to bypass this restriction.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-039. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
