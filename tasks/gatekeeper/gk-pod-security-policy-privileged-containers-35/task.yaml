script:
- prompt: 'This policy prevents pods from running as privileged containers, except
    in the `kube-system` namespace and for images hosted under `safeimages.com/*`.
    Essentially, it enforces a restriction that containers should not have elevated
    privileges unless specifically allowed by these exceptions.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-035. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
