    I need you to check the Services in the gk-unique-service-selector namespace and identify any that have non-unique selectors. Selectors are considered the same if they have identical keys and values. Report the names of only the violating Services, using the following format for each one:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
