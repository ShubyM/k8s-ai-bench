    Pods must set their SELinux context to `system_u:object_r:svirt_sandbox_file_t:s0:c123,c456`.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-036. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
