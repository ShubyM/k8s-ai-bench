- prompt: 'This policy mandates that all Pods must use the `Default` procMount type,
    which restricts access to the `/proc` filesystem.  Images from the `safeimages.com`
    registry are exempt from this requirement, allowing them to potentially use other
    procMount types.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-041''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
