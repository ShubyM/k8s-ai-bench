    I need you to check the Ingress resources in the gk-block-wildcard-ingress Namespace.  Any Ingress that uses a blank or wildcard hostname is not allowed, as that could let someone intercept traffic meant for other services.  Please identify the names of any Ingresses that violate this policy.
    
    Report the violating Ingress resource names in the format: VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
