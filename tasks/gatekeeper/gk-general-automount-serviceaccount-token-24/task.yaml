- prompt: 'This policy prevents pods from automatically mounting service account tokens.
    It applies to all pods, except those in the `kube-system` namespace, ensuring
    that pods explicitly request service account tokens when needed. This enhances
    security by limiting the scope of access for pods.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-024''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
