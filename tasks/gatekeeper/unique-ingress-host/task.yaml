    I need you to check the Ingress resources in the gk-unique-ingress-host Namespace. We want to ensure each Ingress has unique hostnames defined in its rules. If any Ingress resources share the same hostname, please identify them.
    
    Report each violating Ingress using this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
