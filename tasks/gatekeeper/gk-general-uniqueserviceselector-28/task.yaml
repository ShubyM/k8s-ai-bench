    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-028''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
