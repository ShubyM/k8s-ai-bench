    the exact `level`, `role`, `type`, and `user` provided in the policy, namely `s0:c123,c456`,
    `object_r`, `svirt_sandbox_file_t`, and `system_u` respectively.  Pods using a
    different SELinux context will be rejected.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-042''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
