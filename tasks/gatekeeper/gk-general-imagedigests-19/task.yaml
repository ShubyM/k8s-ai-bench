- prompt: 'This policy requires that all container images specified in Pods within
    the `default` namespace must include a digest (a unique content identifier).  This
    ensures that the exact image is always pulled and prevents accidental changes
    or vulnerabilities from being introduced.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-019''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
