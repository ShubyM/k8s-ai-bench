    I need you to check my Kubernetes cluster for any access control issues. Specifically, I want to make sure that no ClusterRoleBindings and RoleBindings are configured to allow the anonymous user or unauthenticated group access, except those using the "cluster-role-1" ClusterRole.
    
    Please inspect all ClusterRoleBindings cluster-wide, and RoleBindings in the gk-disallow-anonymous namespace. Identify any resources that violate this policy.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
