    it allows mounting host paths only if they begin with `/foo` and are mounted read-only;
    any other host path mounts are forbidden.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-038. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
