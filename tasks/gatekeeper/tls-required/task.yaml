    Hey, can you check the Ingress resources in the gk-tls-required namespace? We need to make sure all Ingress resources only allow HTTPS traffic. This means they must have the `kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http` annotation set to `false`.
    
    List all the Ingress resources that violate this policy.
    
    For each violating resource, print exactly one line in this format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
