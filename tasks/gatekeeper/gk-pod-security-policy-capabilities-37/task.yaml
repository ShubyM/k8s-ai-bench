    requires that any Pod only request the `something` capability and must drop the
    `must_drop` capability.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-037. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
