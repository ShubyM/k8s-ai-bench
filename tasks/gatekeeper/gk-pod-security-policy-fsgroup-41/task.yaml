- prompt: 'This policy requires that Pods specify a `fsGroup` within a defined range.
    Specifically, the `fsGroup` must be a numerical value between 1 and 1000, inclusive,
    and the policy enforces that the Pod is allowed to run with this `fsGroup`.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-041''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
