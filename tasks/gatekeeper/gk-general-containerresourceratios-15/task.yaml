- prompt: 'This policy enforces that for every container within a Pod, the requested
    memory (in bytes) must be at least equal to the requested CPU (in millicores),
    and the memory must also be at least ten times the CPU.  Pods violating either
    of these memory-to-CPU ratios will be rejected.


    Two resources have been deployed in namespace ''gk-test-015''. Examine them and
    determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
