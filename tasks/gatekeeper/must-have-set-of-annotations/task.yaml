    I need you to check the Kubernetes cluster and identify any Services in the gk-must-have-set-of-annotations Namespace that are missing required annotations. Specifically, all Services must have both the `a8r.io/owner` and `a8r.io/runbook` annotations, and the values must match the required format (email or GitHub user for owner, URL for runbook).
    
    For each Service that violates this policy, print one line with the following format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
