    containers.  Specifically, it requires that containers are configured to prevent
    privilege escalation, except for Pods using images from the "safeimages.com" registry.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-034. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
