    group IDs, and a file system group ID. All these IDs must be within the numerical
    range of 100 to 200, inclusive.


    Look at the resources that have been deployed in namespace gk-test-028. Examine
    them and determine which resource(s) violate the policy.


    After your analysis, output a single line starting with "VIOLATING:" followed
    by the resource name(s) that violate the policy, or "VIOLATING: none" if all resources
    comply.'
