    I need your help auditing Kubernetes Namespaces in the cluster. I want to ensure all Namespaces have an `owner` label with a value that looks like a company username following the pattern `^[a-zA-Z]+.agilebank.demo$`. Find any Namespaces that are missing this label or have an invalid value for it.
    
    For each Namespace that violates this policy, please print the name of the Namespace in the format:
    VIOLATING: <resource name>
setup: setup.sh
cleanup: cleanup.sh
expect:
- contains: "VIOLATING: resource-beta-\\d+"
- notContains: "VIOLATING: resource-alpha-\\d+"
isolation: cluster
timeout: 5m
